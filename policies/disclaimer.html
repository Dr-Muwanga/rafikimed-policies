        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The content provided by <strong>RafikiMed</strong>, including clinical
          guidelines, algorithms, calculators, tables, charts, and explanatory
          material (collectively "Content"), is made available for
          <strong>educational and informational purposes only</strong>. The
          Content is not intended to constitute medical advice, clinical
          judgment, professional diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>No Substitute for Clinical Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          The Content is not a substitute for the knowledge, skill, training,
          and judgment of licensed healthcare professionals. Healthcare
          decisions must always be made by a qualified clinician using all
          relevant information, including the patient’s history, physical
          examination, laboratory tests, imaging, local practice patterns, and
          applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #c53030">
          In an emergency, do not rely on this site or app — seek immediate
          medical attention or call local emergency services.

        <h2>Specific Limitations — Calculators</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Input validity:</strong> Calculators depend on accurate
            inputs (units, numeric precision). Incorrect or inconsistent units
            will produce incorrect results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Population & validation:</strong> Many equations (e.g.,
            MDRD, CKD-EPI, Cockcroft–Gault) were derived and validated in
            specific populations and may not be accurate in others (children,
            pregnant people, extreme body sizes, certain ethnic groups, acute
            kidney injury, unstable clinical states).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rounding and precision:</strong> Numerical outputs are
            subject to rounding and presentation formatting. Use raw values and
            clinical context when making decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Normalization & indexing:</strong> Some eGFR estimates are
            normalized to a standard body surface area (1.73 m²). Use caution
            when applying normalized eGFR to individuals with very different
            body size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not definitive:</strong> Calculators produce estimates only
            — they do not replace measured values (e.g., measured GFR) or
            clinical testing when clinically required.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Specific Limitations — Guidelines and Algorithms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local adaptation:</strong> Guidelines available in the App may be adapted for local practice. Always confirm local availability, formularies, and protocols before applying a guideline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evidence base and currency:</strong> Clinical guidance evolves. Content may become outdated; always cross-check with the original source literature and up-to-date national or specialty society guidance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Algorithmic simplifications:</strong> Algorithms often simplify complex clinical pathways for practical use. They cannot
            represent every clinical nuance and do not replace detailed clinical reasoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Context matters:</strong> Patient preference, comorbidities, prior therapies, allergies, and resource availability must be considered when applying any recommendation or algorithmic output.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Guidance for Clinicians</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Treat calculator outputs as estimates — combine with clinical  assessment and confirm with tests when required.

            Document clinical reasoning and how you used any tool in the patient's record.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use locally approved formularies, dosing  recommendations, and monitoring protocols where available.

        <h2>Final Note</h2>
        <p>
          We develop and maintain this App to support clinicians and learners. Our goal is to be accurate and useful, but medical care involves judgment and uncertainty — technology is an aid, not a replacement.
